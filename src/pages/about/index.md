title: About HealthScapes

### Background

HealthScapes (HS) was originally developed at UW Madison's Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment, and Global Health Institute. The goal was to create a virtual laboratory for researchers to work on global health problems. Over the years, the original idea has morphed into a series of infectious disease and pharmacovigilence tools through various sectors and global public health emergencies.

### New Vision
In response to COVID-19, HS is being resurrected as a community resource with ideas and lessons derived from past outbreaks and disasters. The project lead (Nico) now lives off grid on the British Columbia coast and is infusing ideas from his background in homesteading, water, energy, paramedicine, and disaster response.

### Timeline
The tools specific to researchers and citizen scientists/technologists have been ported to the Global Ecology, Computing, and Health Organization (GECHO.org). The original software, risk mapping, epidemiology tools, and databases are almost 10 years old and are being rewritten. The collection of digital resources for community resilience, will be ported over to this site throughout the spring of 2020.

### About the author
Nico Preston, PhD, is a sustainability scientist who runs a remote biological research station in British Columbia. He is interested in building community resilience to crises. He has spent the past decade working on global health and disasters, mostly in a supporting role as a technologist and data scientist:
- Natural disasters (Haiti Earthquake 2010)
- Disease outbreaks (MERS CoV 2012, Ebola 2014-2016)
- Digital disease detection (various agencies and outbreaks)
- Pharmacovigilence (Opioids and Fentanyl in the USA)
- Fire and flood (Red Cross Disaster Action Team and volunteer rescue)
- Pre-hospital care (ski patrol and licensed Emergency Medical Responder)
