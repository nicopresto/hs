### Background

HealthScapes (HS) was originally a resource we developed a the University of Wisconsin, Madison's Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment, and Global Health Institute. The goal was to create a virtual laboratory where researchers could work on global health problems. The idea morphed into a series of infectious disease and pharmacovigilence tools over the years.

### New Vision
In response to COVID-19, HS is being resurrected as a community resource with ideas and lessons learnt from past outbreaks and disasters. The project lead (Nico) now lives off grid on the BC Coast and is infusing ideas from his background in homesteading, water resources, paramedicine, and disaster response.

### Timeline
The tools specific to researchers and citizen scientists/technologists have been over at the Global Ecology, Computing, and Health Organization (GECHO.org). The original software, risk mapping, epidemiology tools, and databases are almost 10 years old so they're being rewritten.
